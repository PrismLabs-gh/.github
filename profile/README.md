Hey, we're Prism. We make software, usually because someone chose not to make it or they made it badly (looking at you, OpenAI. Maybe leave making chat clients to people like [Theo](https://t3.gg).)

We hold ourselves to a standard of quality and power. If we don't and our software sucks, go spam spaced about it until he fixes it.

## Projects
### Meridian
An AI client built for two things: Design & Features.
## Donations
