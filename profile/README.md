Hey, we're Prism. We make software, usually because someone chose not to make it or they made it badly (looking at you, OpenAI. Maybe leave making chat clients to people like (Theo)[https://t3.gg].)

We hold ourselves to a standard of quality and power. If we don't and our software sucks, go spam spaced about it until he fixes it.

## Projects
